# poker_go_POC

Proof-of-concept for now. Later I want to convert this to a CLI poker game. 

For hand evaluation Im using twoplustwo algorithm base on [XPokerEval](https://github.com/tangentforks/XPokerEval) repo. To run all this you need to create HandRanks.dat file. Make it via repo table_generator. I need to fix generator, so no go support for now. 

WIP
